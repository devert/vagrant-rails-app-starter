  # Every Vagrant virtual environment requires a box to build off of.

  # This can be set to the host name you wish the guest machine to have.
  config.vm.hostname = "proj-name-dev-box"

  # Create a forwarded port mapping which allows access to a specific port
  # within the machine from a port on the host machine. In the example below,
  # accessing "localhost:3000" will access port 3000 on the guest machine.
  config.vm.network :forwarded_port, guest: 3000, host: 3000

  # Create a private network, which allows host-only access to the machine
  # using a specific IP.
  config.vm.network :private_network, ip: "192.168.33.10"

  # Create a public network, which generally matched to bridged network.
  # Bridged networks make the machine appear as another physical device on
  # your network.
  # config.vm.network :public_network

  # Share an additional folder to the guest VM. The first argument is
  # the path on the host to the actual folder. The second argument is
  # the path on the guest to mount the folder. And the optional third
  # argument is a set of non-required options.

  # Provider-specific configuration so you can fine-tune various
  # backing providers for Vagrant. These expose provider-specific options.
  # Example for VirtualBox:
  config.vm.provider :virtualbox do |vb|
    # Don't boot with headless mode
    # vb.gui = true
  
    # Use VBoxManage to customize the VM. For example, to change memory and 
    # allow symlinks to be created in the shared folder:
    vb.customize ["modifyvm", :id, "--memory", "1024"]
    vb.customize ["setextradata", :id, "VBoxInternal2/SharedFoldersEnableSymlinksCreate/proj-name", "1"]
  end
  # View the documentation for the provider you're using for more
  # information on available options.

  # Requires vagrant-vbguest plugin
  #
  # set auto_update to false, if you do NOT want to check the correct  
  # VirtualBox guest additions version when booting this machine
  # config.vbguest.auto_update = false
  
  # Enable provisioning with chef solo, specifying a cookbooks path, roles
  # path, and data_bags path (all relative to this Vagrantfile), and adding 
  # some recipes and/or roles.
